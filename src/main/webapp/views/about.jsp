<h2>In a world of a highly exploitative housing market, and increasingly competitive economy, education is more important
for an individual's future than ever. We understand that stable living is important to attaining one's educational, or
professional goals, but corporate institutions can be reluctant to accept short term rentals. Be it that you only have a
 semester or two of college left, or maybe you just moved to a new city for a job and you are working on getting your
 "feet on the ground", We want to connect you with your future flatmate, help fill that empty room, find a 3rd renter
 to go in on a house with, or just make short term affordable housing available to those who need it. Life happens in
 moments, be they a month long, or two years, building tools to get people stable housing for the short term allows them
  to focus on what matters most.
